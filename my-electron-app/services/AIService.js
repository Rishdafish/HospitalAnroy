Client: ${patientName}
Date: ${new Date().toLocaleDateString()}
Session Type: Individual Therapy

SUBJECTIVE:
Client reports experiencing increased anxiety symptoms over the past two weeks, particularly in social situations. States, "I feel like everyone is watching me and judging me." Describes physical symptoms including racing heart, shortness of breath, and excessive sweating when in groups. Reports disrupted sleep averaging 5-6 hours per night.

Has shown capacity to implement coping strategies when prompted but struggles with consistent independent application.

PLAN:
1. Continue weekly CBT sessions focusing on challenging cognitive distortions
2. Introduce exposure hierarchy for social anxiety symptoms
3. Assign daily practice of progressive muscle relaxation with tracking log
4. Review and refine relapse prevention strategies
5. Explore potential benefits of adjunctive medication management with psychiatrist`;
